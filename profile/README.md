# Welcome to the CATchment HYdrology (CATHY) project

CATHY (CATchment HYdrology) is an open-source research code, written in Fortran, for simulating coupled surface and subsurface hydrological processes involving water flow and solute transport. 

This group organisation intends to summarize past, current and future activities contributing to the CATHY software. 
This is an early implementation, some sections are still missing.
